# PFw2

 PFw2 (PACFramework V2) is a set of interconnected rules, recommendations, data structures, and software components intended for developing application software for programmable devices such as PLCs and PACs. However, its use is not limited to these platforms. Fundamentally, PFw is a concept and a set of guidelines; the libraries are a secondary element.

PFw2 is the logical continuation of the [PACFramework project](https://github.com/pupenasan/PACFramework/blob/master/README_EN.md).
